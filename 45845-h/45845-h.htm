<h2>Preface</h2>


<p><span class="smcap">A large</span> country, called Russia, lies in the
eastern part of Europe. It stretches from
the icy shores of the Arctic Ocean, on the
north, to the warm waters of the Black Sea, on
the south.</p>

<p>Many of the children of this great country
have fair skins and blue eyes. They belong
to the same race as their English and American
cousins, although they speak a different
language.</p>

<p>Some of them live in palaces, and have
everything that heart could desire; but a vast
number of them are very poor, and their
parents are obliged to work hard to keep the
grim wolf, hunger, away from the door.</p>

<p>Russia, as a nation, is very young, as compared
with many others. She is still in her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_vi" id="Page_vi">[vi]</a></span>
childhood. Perhaps it is because of this that
her people do not enjoy as much freedom as
ourselves.</p>

<p>A few years ago the Emperor of Russia
spoke some words to which the people of the
western world listened with surprise and delight.
He said, "I wish there were peace
between all countries, and that we could settle
our differences with each other without fighting."
These wise words did a great deal of
good. The emperor, without doubt, meant
what he said. He did wish heartily that wars
should be at an end. He has not felt able,
however, to carry out his ideas of peace, for at
this very moment he is at war with the people
of Japan.</p>

<p>Let us hope that this war will soon be over,
and that the nation to which our Russian
Cousin belongs will become as truly free and
wise as she is now large and powerful.</p>

<h2>Our Little Russian Cousin</h2>


<p><span class="smcap">Petrovna</span> is a dainty little floweret of the
cold lands far away. She is your little Russian
cousin. Her home is in the largest country
of this great round ball, the Earth. How
fair are her cheeks, how blue her eyes, and
what long, beautiful, yellow hair she has! Her
hands are so white and soft and plump, I
know you would like to squeeze them.</p>

<p>She is very gentle and ladylike. Her
mamma has taught her that is the right way
to behave. Yet she is full of fun, and laughs
at every joke that her brother Ivan makes.
They have great sport together, these two
children. Petrovna is ten, and Ivan eight
years old.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span></p>

<p>Sometimes they play they are grown up,
just as you do. Then Petrovna puts on her
mother's gown with a long train, and Ivan
dresses himself up like a soldier. Petrovna
"makes believe" that she is a princess at the
court of the Emperor. She powders her hair,
and puffs it on the top of her head, and places
feathers in it. Ivan cuts shining ornaments
out of a sheet of tin and fastens them on his
coat. He pretends that these were given him
for bravery in battle.</p>

<p>These little children live in a fine city near
the sea. Its name is St. Petersburg. The
streets look very much like those of Chicago
and New York. There are many grand palaces,
however, and the churches are quite
different from ours.</p>

<p>Perhaps you would like to know why St.
Petersburg was built. A long time ago Peter
the Great was the ruler of Russia. There was
no large city in the country near the sea at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>
that time. Peter said, "If my country is
to be powerful, I must have a city that is
near the coast and that looks toward the
rest of Europe."</p>

<p>Peter went to the shores of the river Neva,
near the Baltic Sea. The land was low and
marshy. That did not matter to him. He
sent out an order for workmen. Great numbers
of men came to the spot he had chosen,
to prepare it for streets and houses. Thousands
of piles must first be driven into the
marshy soil. Millions of stones must be
brought to fill it up before streets could be
laid. It was such unhealthful work that, before
the city was finished, hundreds of the
poor workmen died of fever. But the work
was done, and Peter the Great went to live
there.</p>

<p>He brought all his court with him. He
made the place his capital. It is now the
most important city of Russia, and one of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>
the largest in the world. It is often called
the "Czar's Window," because he is said to
look out over Europe from this place. (I forgot
to tell you that the Emperor of Russia
is called the Czar.)</p>

<p>Let us come back to Petrovna and Ivan,
who are just going out on the river to skate.
Their home is almost a palace, it is so big and
grand. Their father is a merchant. He buys
tea from the East and sells it to the people
of his own country. He has grown so rich
that he owns a fine house in the city, in which
the family live during the long, cold winter.
They go to another home on an island of the
river Neva in the summer-time.</p>

<p>Let us look into the big drawing-room,
where papa and mamma entertain their friends
in the evening. How high the walls are!
At one side of the room is an immense porcelain
stove. It looks somewhat like a tomb.
It is big enough for a play-house for Petrovna<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>
and Ivan. A big wood fire is built in the
stove on cold winter mornings. When it
has burnt down to glowing coals, the chimney
is closed up, and port-holes from the stove
are opened. Then the heat rushes out into
the room. How close the air becomes! You
do not wonder at it when you look around
and notice that there are three sets of windows
at each casing. There is only one pane in
the whole room which can be opened to let
in the outside air. The Russians are afraid
of having the cold enter their houses. They
have enough of it out-of-doors during at least
six months of the year.</p>

<p>What is that strange-looking vessel on the
side table? It is of shining copper. The
maid polishes it very often, as it is used every
evening by papa and mamma. They call it a
"samovar," and no Russian home is complete
without one. You probably can't guess the
reason, so I will have to tell you.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span></p>

<p>You must understand that the people of
this far-away land are great tea-drinkers. Tea
in the morning, tea at noon, tea at night, and
tea between-whiles. They like it fresh, too.
Tea always tastes best and is least harmful
when drunk as soon as it is made. So these
good Russians must have something near
them on which to heat the water. In the
middle of the samovar is a cylinder in which
hot coals are placed, and the water is heated
around this cylinder.</p>

<p>The boiling water is taken out whenever it
is wanted and poured on the tea in papa's
tumbler or mamma's cup. No milk, if you
please, to suit their taste, and no sugar <i>in</i> the
tea. They prefer to take a lump of the very
hardest sugar in their fingers and nibble it as
they swallow the beverage they like so much.</p>

<p>A slice of lemon is often put in the tumbler
with the tea. People in our own country
have begun to copy this custom, and drink<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>
what we call "Russian tea." No doubt you
have heard of it.</p>

<p>Let us turn to the wall and notice the large
picture of the Madonna and the infant Jesus
hanging there. A lamp is burning in front
of it. If Petrovna comes into the room now,
she will go to that picture at once and cross
herself before it. Every devout Russian has
at least one religious picture in his house, and
will always pay it reverence when he enters.</p>

<p>If a thief should happen to come into Petrovna's
house in the night, he would not dare
to steal in the presence of such a picture,
however brave he might be. He would first
hang a cloth over the painting. Then he
would go on with his wicked work without
further thought.</p>

<p>There is a large organ in this grand drawing-room.
It is played almost automatically.
(A big word, isn't it?) Petrovna and Ivan
have music boxes here, as the Russians are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>
very fond of music. I fear they are rather
lazy, though, for many of their musical instruments
do not depend on the skill of those
who play upon them. They make what we
call mechanical music.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 341px;">
<img src="images/illus013.jpg" width="341" height="500" alt="Woman and toddler" />
<div class="caption">BABY BROTHER AND HIS NURSE.</div>
</div>

<p>There are several little tables about the
room, as Petrovna's mamma and papa are
fond of playing cards with their friends. Indeed,
you need not be surprised at seeing the
rich merchant playing a game at his store any
hour of the day. He smokes and drinks tea
while he plays. And mamma does the same.
Yes, my dears, the women of Russia, of your
own white race, roll their dainty cigarettes and
smoke them as commonly as the men do.
Petrovna will doubtless do this very thing
when she is older. When she comes to
America she will probably be much surprised
to see only men practising the habit.</p>

<p>Petrovna and Ivan go to bed much later
than their cousins across the Atlantic, while<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>
their parents often sit up till three or four
o'clock in the morning. Such a gay city as
they live in! Balls and parties, theatres and
sleigh-rides, night after night in the winter
season. Of course people cannot rise early
for breakfast if they are awake nearly all night.
It is not often that Petrovna's papa goes to
his store before ten or eleven o'clock in the
morning. The whole city looks sleepy and dismal
before that time. The sky is gray and
dreary, and the fog is thick and damp. The
stores are closed, and few people are to be
seen.</p>

<p>But it is dinner-time. Here come the children
with their skates on their arms, and with
them are the nurse and their baby brother.
He has been out for a ride in his little sleigh.
He is wrapped up so tightly you can hardly
see his fat cheeks and the dimple in his chin.</p>

<p>As nurse takes off her hood and cape, I
want you to notice her dress. It is the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>
national costume of Russia. She wears a
loose white undergarment with full short
sleeves. It is low in the neck. She has a
dark skirt over this. The band is fastened
around her body under the arms, while straps
over the shoulders hold it in place. I must
not forget to mention a large white apron,
which is fastened by a belt around her waist.
Nor would she think herself dressed without
her ear-rings and bead necklace. The moment
her hood is taken off she puts a high
cap of bright-coloured muslin on her head.
This is always worn in the house to show she
is a married woman.</p>

<p>And here come papa and mamma. Papa is
a fine-looking man with a long beard. Mamma
looks good and kind, and has a sweet voice,
but she could not be called pretty.</p>

<p>Dinner is waiting, and all have fine appetites.
As they enter the dining-room they do
not sit down to the table at once. One by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>
one they go up to a sideboard where all sorts
of cold dishes are served. There are dried
beef, smoked salmon, cheese, radishes, and
other relishes of which Russians are fond.
Each one helps himself to some of these dainties.
They take small portions, however, for
this is what they call the zakushka, or appetiser.
You need not try to pronounce it
unless you wish. It is to make them hungrier
for the solid meal, which comes afterward.
How these people do eat! First there is
cabbage soup, made of chopped cabbage which
has been boiled with a piece of meat. Petrovna
first dips her spoon into a dish of
barley beside her plate, and then into the
soup. She is very fond of this national dish.
The richest and the poorest people, even the
Czar himself, eat it continually and never tire
of it. The only difference is that the poor
peasant can seldom afford the meat which
improves its flavour so much.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span></p>

<p>Next comes a pie made of fish and raisins.
It seems rather queer to us to have these two
things cooked together, but our Russian cousins
think it is very good. And now a roast
lamb is served with salted cucumbers, followed
by buckwheat pudding, and ices, for dessert.</p>

<p>Last, but not least, the samovar is set on
the table, and cup after cup of delicious tea
is drunk by the family.</p>

<p>I forgot to tell you that sour cream was
served with the soup, and papa and mamma
drank some cordial while they ate of the
zakushka. This was to encourage their
appetites still more. But I certainly can't
see what need there was. They ate and ate,
and drank tea and still more tea, till it seemed
as if they would be made ill.</p>

<p>It is said that Russians are among the
largest eaters in the world. If this be so, I
do not wonder that so many of them grow
stout. This makes me think of a story I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>
read the other day. Perhaps you would like
to hear it. There was a certain soldier in
Russia who ate so much that his friends used
to lay wagers with strangers as to the quantity
he could eat at a single time. His friends
generally won, too. It happened one day
that the colonel of the regiment made a large
wager that the man could eat a whole sheep
at one meal. The cook prepared the sheep in
many ways, in order to encourage the man's
appetite. Of one part he made a pie, of
another a stew, of still another a hash, and so
on.</p>

<p>The man swallowed one preparation after
another until the sheep was almost eaten, when
he looked up and said, "If you give me so
much zakushka, I am afraid I will not be able
to eat the sheep when it is brought in." You
understand the joke, of course, when you remember
that the zakushka is made of the
side dishes one eats before the regular meal<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>
is begun. Of course the colonel won his
bet.</p>

<p>Besides the cabbage soup, there are still
others of which the Russians are very fond.
One of these is made with cold beer with
pieces of cucumber, meat, and red herrings
floating about in it, as well as bits of ice.
Still another is made of a fish called the
sterlet, which is found only in the Volga,
the principal river of Russia. Then there
are trout soup, perch soup, and several other
kinds of which you probably never heard.</p>

<p>But now let us leave the dinner-table and
go out into Petrovna's yard. At one end
of it there is a high platform. It is built at
least twenty feet above the ground. Steps
lead up to it on one side, while from the
other a long slant reaches down to a frozen
pond below. This slant looks as though it
were solid shining ice. But underneath there
are stout boards to keep it smooth and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>
unbending. They are fastened to a very
strong framework. Now guess, if you please,
why this ice hill, as it is called, was made in
Petrovna's back yard. To amuse her and
her little brother, of course.</p>

<p>They are very fond of coasting. They like
it even better than skating. So their thoughtful
papa hired two workmen. They made the
framework and laid great blocks of ice close
together upon the slant. They then poured
water over the ice to make it perfectly smooth.
The cold winds blew upon it. It froze solid
in a few minutes, and not a crack in the ice can
be seen. It will last all winter, for in Russia
the warm days, that we sometimes have in
January, are scarcely known.</p>

<p>Petrovna and Ivan take their sleds every
morning as soon as lessons are over, and away
they run up the steps of their ice hill. Hurrah!
Now hold your breath, for away they go, faster
and faster, down the hill and over the pond<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>
below. How they shout with delight! They
travel more quickly than any express train you
ever saw.</p>

<p>I am afraid you will be a little envious of
their fun and wish you had a private ice hill
like theirs. The best part of it is that these
little Russians don't have to wait for a good
snow-storm to make coasting for them. It
is always on hand and made to order.</p>

<p>Petrovna has a hill made of polished wood
at her summer home on the island. It cost
a good deal of money, but her papa thought,
"What does that matter? The children like
coasting better than any other sport, so coasting
they shall have."</p>

<p>There are public ice-hills in several parts of
the city. Both old and young people are very
fond of coasting. The Emperor himself has a
slide of beautiful mahogany in his palace. It
has been polished until it shines like one of
the finest pieces of furniture.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span></p>

<p>Petrovna and Ivan do not go to school as
some of the poor children do. They have a
French governess. She teaches them to read,
write, and spell. She also gives them lessons
in French and German. She is a fine scholar,
and Petrovna's papa and mamma respect her
greatly. She is treated like one of the family
and meets all of their friends. Petrovna's
mamma wished her children's governess to
be a Frenchwoman, because French is generally
spoken in good society in Russia. Of
course she can teach them to pronounce it
better than a person of their own country
could.</p>

<p>Besides the two languages they are studying
now, Ivan and Petrovna will soon take Latin,
and perhaps Italian. Well-educated people
of Russia often speak several different languages.
But there are thousands, yes, millions
of the poor in their land who cannot
read their own language or even write their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>
own names! The schools are not as common,
you see, as in this country, but they are growing
better every year.</p>

<p>By the way, I must tell you that there are
more than forty different tongues spoken in
the various parts of the great country of Russia.
If you learned to speak the Russian
language in one part of it, you might not
understand what the people say in a different
part.</p>

<p>In Petrovna's yard there is a little house
close to the main one. If she should let you
look in, you would see a large brick oven at
the end of the room. Wide shelves are
fastened one above another on the side of
the wall. You can't imagine what this place
is used for, so I shall certainly have to tell
you. It is the family bath-house. I can
hear you cry, "What a bath-house! I don't
see any tub, or, in fact, <i>anything</i> that looks
like a bath-house." But the children of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>
Russia do not take water baths as you do.
They are bathed by steam.</p>

<p>Every Saturday a big fire is made in the
stove, and when the bricks are very hot, water
is poured over them. The room is filled with
hot steam. Petrovna delights in this weekly
bath. At first she lies on a low shelf until
she gets quite warm. The perspiration starts
out all over her little naked body. Then her
maid places her on a higher shelf and pours
more water over the stove. More steam
rises, and Petrovna grows warmer and warmer.
It seems as though she would suffocate. Now
for a still higher shelf in the room. Of course
the higher up the little girl goes, the hotter
she grows. The water fairly runs out of the
pores of her skin, now. Instead of looking
like a lily, she would remind you of a boiled
lobster.</p>

<p>Shouldn't you think she would get cold
after a hot bath like that, especially as she<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>
is going out of doors into the freezing air?
She never does, however, and I will tell you
why. When she has been steamed enough,
she is slowly cooled off by having first warm
and then cold water poured over her. When
all is finished, and she has been rubbed down,
she feels as fresh and sweet as a flower.</p>

<p>She is ready for the next day's duty and
pleasure now. To-morrow is the Sabbath,
and every good Russian takes his bath on
the day before. Sunday morning comes.
Every one of the family wears his holiday
clothes, for, after breakfast, all will attend
church service.</p>

<p>Petrovna's mamma has promised to take
her to-day to the cathedral of St. Mark.
She is so pleased she can hardly wait till the
time comes to put on her wraps. No hat
for her, if you please. That would not keep
her dear little head warm enough. She wears
a hood with a deep cape, and a long white<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>
cloak of astrakhan. Perhaps you have a muff
of the same material. I wonder if you think
it is fur. Astrakhan is the soft white fleece
taken from the new-born lamb of a peculiar
kind of sheep. The sooner the baby lamb is
killed, the handsomer is the wool. Every year
thousands of sheep are raised in Asia so that
the beautiful white, gray, and black astrakhan
can be sent to Russia, and to people in other
parts of the world.</p>

<p>Petrovna wears her hood and cloak with
the wool inside to keep her all the warmer.
Her mamma has a hood and cloak of the
richest sable. It cost thousands of dollars.
You cannot see its beauty, for she wears it
with the fur on the inside to keep her comfortable,
just as Petrovna does.</p>

<p>The sleigh is at the door, and it is time
to leave. What a curious one it is! It is
low and small, and the back of the seat is so
low that Petrovna might fall over backward<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>
if she were not used to it. There is just
room enough for the little girl and her
mamma, with a small seat in front for the
coachman. Notice his queer clothes and his
funny-looking hat. It makes you think of
a battered stovepipe. The upper part of the
crown is much wider than the lower part, and
the narrow brim curls up. His blue cloak
is quite loose, and has a long plaited skirt.
It is fastened on one side with six metal buttons.
A heavy leather belt is clasped around
his waist.</p>

<p>Observe the horses. They are fine-looking
animals, but how queerly they are harnessed.
The middle one has a high wooden yoke about
his neck. The rest of the harness is fastened
to that. The horses on the outside are attached
to the one in the middle by a single
rein. They are left quite free in their motions.
They are called madmen. Some sleighs
have one horse, some two, and some three.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span></p>

<p>And now Petrovna and her mamma are
seated, the fur robes are tucked snugly in,
the coachman jumps to his seat and makes
a kind of clucking noise. The horses rush
onward at a furious rate, and still Petrovna
calls out, "Faster!" She is not afraid of
accident, nor is she satisfied, although the
horses seem to be doing their best. Russians
are not fond of exercising themselves, but they
dearly like to be moved as fast as possible.
This is why they like sleighing and coasting
better than any other sports.</p>

<p>As Petrovna rides along she finds that the
streets are full of sleighs, yet they do not
sound so merry as they do in our own land.
What is the difference? There are no sleigh-bells.
There is a law that none can be used
in the cities of Russia. I will tell you the
reason. There are so many sleighs, and the
streets are so crowded with them (for hardly
any person walks), that the drivers would get<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>
confused by the sound of so many bells, and
run into each other. There is a very
severe punishment for the one who causes
such an accident. But strange to say, although
there is so much driving, few people
are injured. The coachmen are very careful,
although they probably drive faster than the
people of any other country.</p>

<div class="caption">A VERY GRAND BUILDING.</div>
</div>

<p>In a few minutes Petrovna and her mamma
arrive in front of a very grand building. This
is the cathedral. Papa and the rest of the
family drive up at the same time, and all
alight. See the crowd of beggars at the gates!
There are poor men and women who ask for
enough money to buy a dinner of coarse black
bread. There are nuns who are asking alms
to support their convent. Few people are
willing to refuse at the very doors of the
church.</p>

<p>The cathedral is built in the shape of a
cross. All churches in Russia are built in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>
the same way. But notice these massive steps.
Each is cut out of a single block of granite.
Stand off a little and look at the great, shining
dome. It is made of copper but is covered
thickly with gold. It is so far up, and shines
so brightly in the sunlight, that it is a beacon-light
to the sailors far out on the sea.</p>

<p>Now let us follow our little cousin and enter
the cathedral. How dark, and yet how beautiful
it is! There are no seats. Rich and poor
are standing together in worship. See those
great columns of beautiful stones. The delicate
sea-green is malachite. That heavenly
blue is lapis lazuli. Does it not make you
think of fairy-land? Notice, please, the number
of beautiful pictures. There are no
statues or images in the building, because the
Russian Church does not think it right to
worship them.</p>

<p>Listen to the music. There is no organ,
but hidden from sight is a choir of men<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>
who are chanting. Are not their voices fine?
Would you not like to stay all day to listen
to such music? But what is Petrovna doing?
As she entered the church she bought a candle
at a stand near the door. Now she brings
it to a shrine at the side of the great building.
She offers it to a priest, who lights it and
places it in a silver stand in front of the sacred
picture. There are several holes in the stand,
in which other candles are burning. The
priest allows each candle to burn only a
minute or two, because many other people
keep coming up. They wish to have their
candles burn there also.</p>

<p>As our dear little cousin stands there crossing
herself devoutly, let us notice the picture
of the Madonna before which the candles are
burning. Her dress, as well as the halo
around her head, is fairly covered with gold
and silver and precious stones. Good and
pious people have spent thousands of dollars<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>
for these beautiful gems. The only parts not
covered are the face and hands. The background,
even, is covered with gold. There
are many other such shrines in the cathedral.
A white-robed priest attends to the candles,
which are kept burning night and day in each
one of these shrines.</p>

<p>The church is filled with the odour of incense.
Through the faint blue smoke we can
still watch Petrovna as she stands throughout
the service. Now and then she bows her
body to the floor, or crosses herself as some
sacred name is repeated.</p>

<p>And now it is over. A ride once more, and
home is reached. The rest of the day is
given up to play and pleasure. Papa goes to
his club for a game of cards. Perhaps Petrovna
and Ivan will go out coasting, or
mamma will take them for a visit to some
friends. After church service, Sunday in
Russia is a gala-day for rich and poor. It is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>
a time for parties in winter, and picnics in
the summer-time.</p>

<p>Sometimes in the morning Petrovna and
her brother go to early market with the maid.
It is more fun in winter than in summer, even
though "Jack Frost" is on the watch to nip
off their noses. Snow is everywhere to be
seen on the housetops and fences, and great
drifts of snow are being dug out in the streets.
Icicles are hanging from every corner. Yes,
Jack Frost is a merry-looking fellow, but he
is ready to bite you if he has half a chance.
Petrovna touches her nose and cheeks every
little while to be sure they are not numb. It
is so easy in northern Russia to find oneself
with a frozen ear or nose. A disagreeable
surprise party, indeed.</p>

<p>But the market! You never saw anything
like it. It is well that it is called "the frozen
market." Here are whole sheep standing on
their stiff, frozen legs, and looking at you with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>
their frozen eyes. Beside them are pigs with
their four legs pulled outwards, and looking,
oh! so queer and odd. Quails, grouse,
chickens, ducks, partridges,&mdash;all kinds of
fowls and game, and all frozen. They have
been frozen for weeks, and will stay so in this
frosty air till they are handed over to the
hard-hearted cooks. Then into the oven they
will go, and come out, brown and tender, on
the dinner-table.</p>

<p>Russia is a great place for game of all kinds.
In the market there are great piles of fish in a
solid frozen heap. Petrovna takes hold of a
string, and lifts a brick of frozen milk. That
is the way milk is sold. No quart measures
are needed in winter in St. Petersburg.</p>

<p>The children ask the maid to take the long
way home, for they wish to look again at the
statue of their loved Kriloff. How dear he is
to all Russian children! His stories of dogs,
cats, rabbits, foxes, squirrels, and other living<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>
creatures, bring them nearer to the hearts of
everybody. The figures of many of the animals
that live in his stories are carved on
his monument.</p>

<p>But look! What is all this commotion
about? See the crowd gathering on the sidewalks.
The street is cleared by the police,
for the Emperor is coming, the Great White
Czar. First comes a squadron of cavalry, and
behind them is the royal sleigh. It is drawn
by two beautiful horses. Three officers sit in
the sleigh with the Emperor.</p>

<p>What a fine face and figure he has! He
looks kind and noble, but worn with the cares
of his great empire. As he passes along, the
people cheer with might. They love him
with all their hearts. He is the head of their
Church. He is the father of this great people.
They worship him, and would save him all
his care if they could. But alas! there are
enemies in this very city who may even now<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>
be plotting to take his life. They do not
believe in kings, nor, indeed, in rulers of any
kind. They work secretly against him with
other people all over Russia. Although from
time to time they are discovered and killed or
sent into exile, others take their places. This
great ruler, who is warmly loved by his subjects,
is in danger of his life all the time. No
wonder he looks so careworn.</p>

<p>Petrovna and Ivan look long and tenderly
after him, cheering till their little throats are
quite tired out. Then they hurry home to
tell mamma what they have seen to-day.</p>

<p>At dinner Ivan said, "Papa, I wish you
would tell me something about the Cossacks.
They seem to go everywhere the Czar does.
I noticed them in the body of cavalry this
morning. They look and dress so differently
from us, but they ride their horses nobly. I
would like to look like a Cossack when on
horseback."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span></p>

<p>"They are noble men, indeed," said papa.
"Their home is far away from us, in the south
of Russia. A long time ago they were at war
with us, but now they are good friends and
strong defenders of our country. In time of
war they are the spies and scouts. They are
so faithful that the Emperor can feel perfectly
safe when they are near. They pay no taxes,
but give their services in the army instead."</p>

<p>"Papa," interrupted Ivan, "why do they
wear long beards and have no buttons on
their coats? That is not like the rest of the
cavalry. And they carry no cartridge-boxes."</p>

<p>"That is true," was the reply. "The Cossacks
detest buttons, and hook their coats
over, just as ladies often do. The cartridges
are carried in a row of pockets on the breasts
of their coats. You see they are a very independent
people, and insist on dressing in their
own manner. The Czar allows them to do
so because they are so good in other ways.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span></p>

<p>"You should see them in war. They dare
to go into the greatest of dangers. They
admire bravery more than anything else in
the world. Just before a battle they wash
themselves and dress with the greatest care.
They believe that they must be clean if they
would enter heaven. But when the battle is
over they draw up in line, leaving empty
places for their fellows who have fallen. Then
they sing sad songs in memory of them.</p>

<p>"In their own home they treat each other
like brothers, and share the land in common.
They are good to their cattle and horses.
After a long march they will always care for
their horses and feed them before doing anything
for themselves. Before they eat they
always wash themselves, oil their hair, and
pray. They are as fond of tea as we are,
my boy.</p>

<p>"But this is enough for to-night. I hope
you will study your history carefully as you<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>
grow older. I want you to know more about
the Cossacks, as well as many other interesting
people who live in this great strong country
of ours."</p>

<p>Not many miles from the fine city in which
Petrovna lives are some other children whose
home is very different from hers. Their
parents are peasants who were serfs not many
years ago. A serf was one kind of slave, for
he belonged either to the Emperor or some
rich nobleman. He could be bought and sold
just like a horse. But the grandfather of the
present Czar said, "My people must all be free.
No human being in my empire shall be a slave
any longer." That was the end of serfdom.</p>

<p>But these people are still very, very poor.
Few of them can read a book. Many of
them are lazy and fond of strong drink.
They live in little villages all over Russia.
There are more peasants than all other classes
of people in the country.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span></p>

<p>Petrovna's papa must soon go to one of
these villages on business. His little daughter
is going with him. She is sorry for the poor
peasants. She wishes she could give their
children some pretty playthings like hers.
She carries a new red skirt for a little girl
there whom she knows.</p>

<p>The village looks very bare in the winter
season. It is still more so in the summer
time. No trees, no sidewalks, scanty gardens,
and scarcely what you could call a street.
Only wide pathways between the rows of
huts, which are huddled together. There is
only one two-story house in the place. This
is owned by the storekeeper or village merchant.
He sells the peasants everything they
need to buy. He is not of the peasant
class himself. He came to live here in order
to make money out of these poor men and
women. The village well, from which every
one in the place draws his water, is near his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>
house. On the side of the well hangs a sacred
picture, so that every one who comes there
may worship first.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 340px;">
<img src="images/illus029.jpg" width="340" height="500" alt="woman carrying two buckets on wooden post over her shoulder in village with wooden houses" />
<div class="caption">IN THE PEASANT VILLAGE.</div>
</div>

<p>On the front of each hut are three little
windows, close together. The sashes and
frames are painted a bright red, or perhaps
a gaudy purple. The Russian peasant is very
fond of colour, and will work hard for the
sake of a new red shirt for himself or a yellow
skirt for his wife.</p>

<p>The porch and doorway are on one side of
the hut. In summer time an earthen kettle
hangs down from the roof, and as the father
comes home from his work he will stop a
moment and tip a little water out of the kettle
over his hands. He rubs them together and
wipes himself on the tail of his shirt. This
is the only washing he has except the weekly
steaming in the village bath-house.</p>

<p>Look at the flocks of pigeons around the
house. They are very tame. They appear<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>
well fed and fat. In Russia the pigeon or
dove is a sacred bird and is never harmed.
The rough peasant will share his last crust
with a pigeon.</p>

<p>Petrovna goes to the door of one of the
cottages and passes inside. Oh dear, how close
the place is! It smells strongly of the cabbage
soup boiling for the day's dinner. Only one
small room in the house. Yet there is a
large family of children living here, besides
half a dozen shaggy-haired dogs. With the
exception of the big brick stove, there is no
furniture except what the father made himself.
In one corner of the room is a rickety table.</p>

<p>A narrow bench is built against the wall
on two sides of the room. There are no
chairs and no beds. How do they get along?
And yet they seem quite happy and comfortable.
Papa and mamma sleep up on top
of the big stove. The older children sleep
beside them. Don't worry, my dears. They<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>
do not get burned, but like their hard, warm
bed very much. The logs burn down to ashes
in the daytime. The bricks are just pleasantly
warm by night.</p>

<p>But the little girl to whom Petrovna has
brought the dress, and her three-year-old
brother, where do they sleep? On the benches
against the walls. If they should have bad
dreams and tumble off in the night, it would
not matter so very much, for the bench is near
the floor.</p>

<p>When meal time comes, the family does not
gather around the table, for as I told you,
there are no seats that can be moved. They
sit on the benches, and the table is therefore
kept in the corner of the room. They can
sit at only two sides of it, of course.</p>

<p>But I have not yet spoken of the most important
thing in the house. It is the Ikon, or
sacred picture. The priest blessed it before
it was brought to the home. There is a place<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>
for a candle to burn in front of it, but these
poor people cannot afford to keep one lighted
all the time. This picture has no gold upon
it, like the one in Petrovna's house. It cost
only a few pennies, but it is sacred, nevertheless.
The family give it reverence many times
a day. It is never forgotten as they enter
the room.</p>

<p>It sometimes happens, I am sorry to say,
that the father comes home the worse for
taking strong drink. Perhaps he cannot walk
straight, and hangs his head from side to side.
But when he opens the door, he remembers
to turn to the sacred picture and cross himself
before it.</p>

<p>Although there is so little furniture and so
few windows, the room looks bright and gay.
The table is painted a gorgeous red, while the
benches are a brilliant green.</p>

<p>Black bread made from coarse rye-meal,
cabbage soup, weak tea (for they cannot<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>
afford to have it strong), are the daily food
of the peasants. If they can get some buckwheat
and dried herring, once in awhile, they
think themselves well-off.</p>

<p>They have many happy times, these poor
people of Russia. When work is done for
the day, they dance and sing, and play upon
the concertina, if any one in the village owns
one of these cheap musical instruments.</p>

<p>When Petrovna takes out the red dress for
the little girl and a large package of buckwheat
which mamma has sent to the family,
every one in the house shouts with delight.
It seems as though they could not thank her
enough. Even the dogs wake up and begin
to bark in excitement. In the midst of it all
Petrovna's papa calls for her. She must go
back to the grand city and her fine home.
She will forget for a time that all children in
the world cannot be as well dressed and well
fed as herself.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span></p>

<p>Petrovna has never yet been far away from
St. Petersburg. She longs to go to the beautiful
white-walled city of Moscow. Her mamma
has been there, and has described its beauties
over and over again.</p>

<p>It is a long journey from St. Petersburg.
As you draw near the city, a blaze of colour
is spread out before you. Domes of red and
gold and purple are shining on the hilltops
in the glorious sunlight. Churches and towers
and palaces are without number, and differ
from each other in shape and beauty. Moscow
is a mass of colour made of countless
gems and countless tints. In the midst of
the city is the Kremlin or citadel. But the
Kremlin is not one building. It is really a
fortress surrounded by a massive wall that
encloses many palaces and cathedrals, beautiful
gardens and stately convents. Great gates
open into it, and each has its story. One of
them is called the Nicholas gate. A picture<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span>
of St. Nicholas, whom the Russians worship,
hangs over it. At one time the French were
at war with the Russians. They stormed this
gate and split its solid stonework, but the
picture was unharmed. "It is a miracle," the
people said.</p>

<p>There is a picture of the Virgin over another
gate. The French tried to get this picture,
but they did not succeed. This was another
miracle, all thought, and no one passes through
that gate now without taking off his hat.
Within the Kremlin are other sacred pictures,
which the people believe can work miracles.</p>

<p>The oil of baptism is prepared and blessed
by the high-priest in a certain cathedral in
Moscow. It is sent to every church in
Russia, that all new-born children may be
baptised with it.</p>

<p>Petrovna's mamma went to the city of
Moscow when the Czar was crowned. He
could not be formally made Emperor in St.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span>
Petersburg. That was not to be thought of.
All Czars must be married as well as crowned
in Moscow, and, until the time of Peter the
Great, all have been buried there.</p>

<p>The coronation of the present Czar was the
greatest spectacle of modern times. Petrovna
hears her mamma sigh when she tries to describe
it. Everything was so grand and shining
and gorgeous,&mdash;processions and fireworks,
music and feasting, everybody pleased and
gaily dressed; men in silk and velvet, ladies
sparkling in satins covered with pearls and
diamonds; the double-headed eagle, the bird
of Russia, showing its gilded crowns everywhere.</p>

<p>In the evening there were no rockets and
Roman candles, but fireworks that were constantly
shining, while the fronts of the buildings
were covered with candles burning in
glass globes.</p>

<p>Such horses, such elegant carriages, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span>
such fine parks to drive in! And through
the city ran the river, reflecting the lights
from all sides.</p>

<p>There were days and days of feasting, from
the time the new Emperor arrived in the city.
He appeared in the grand procession mounted
on a snow-white horse. He was dressed very
simply in dark green, wearing a cap of astrakhan.
Behind him came a great array of
princes and grand-dukes. Next came the
Emperor's mother in a carriage drawn by
eight superb horses. After this appeared the
carriage of the Empress. It was all of gold,
and also drawn by eight snow-white horses.</p>

<p>How the crowd cheered, and cheered again!
If this could show how devoted the people
were to their ruler, their love could not be
measured.</p>

<p>The governor of the city came out to meet
the Czar and presented him with bread and
salt.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span></p>

<p>These are the emblems of trust and friendship.
Then the royal family rode onward till
they came to a little chapel, where the Emperor
and Empress alighted. They passed in alone
to worship.</p>

<p>Now to the Kremlin, where a multitude was
waiting for them. There were thousands of
the peasants, who had travelled hundreds of
miles on foot. They wished to see, if only
for one moment, the head of their Church and
State. There were princes and officers from
every country of the world. There were
Chinese mandarins, Persian rulers, wealthy
Indians, people of all colours and races. And
all were dressed in the richest robes that
money could buy and art design. Such a
mass of colour! Such sparkling of precious
stones! Such a wealth of satin and lace and
velvet and cloth of silver and gold!</p>

<p>After his entrance of triumph into the city,
the Emperor and Empress retired from the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span>
public eye for three days. They must fast
and pray until the time that the Czar should
be crowned, else they would not be in right
condition for this ceremony. But the others
in the crowded city did not fast. The days
were given to pleasures of all kinds,&mdash;eating,
drinking, music, and dancing.</p>

<p>At last the Czar was crowned! It was in
the cathedral, where all other Czars have been
crowned before. He himself put on the robe
and collar, and assumed the crown of empire.
The heavy crown of gold was placed on his
head by his own hands. He then made a
noble prayer for himself and the great empire,
and for the millions of people who are his
devoted subjects. How fair and strong and
kindly was his face! Never had Petrovna's
mamma seen anything so grand or so solemn.
She stops and repeats a prayer now for the
good Emperor Nicholas II.</p>

<p>When the ceremony was ended there was a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span>
ringing of bells all over the city. Hundreds
of cannon were fired. Then more feasting
and merriment followed for days yet to come.
Free dinners were served every day to five
thousand of the poor. The Czar did not
forget them. They feasted as they had never
done before in their lives.</p>

<p>At last came the great day of the festival.
It was called the "people's fête." Every one
was welcome. There were shows of all kinds
that you can imagine. There were concerts
and plays, boxing and fencing matches, trained
animals,&mdash;everything to make the people
happy. Overlooking it all sat the Czar in a
grand pavilion. All the lords and ladies of
the land were about him.</p>

<p>How delightful it was! Petrovna's mamma
leans back in her chair and smiles softly to
herself as she thinks of that joyful time.</p>

<p>On many a winter evening, as they sit
around the big porcelain stove and sip the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span>
tea, Petrovna and Ivan beg for stories. They
like fairy tales best of all. Their favourite
one is the story of "Frost." Perhaps you
would like to hear it.</p>

<p>Once upon a time there was a man who had
three children. His wife was extremely fond
of two of the daughters, but she was cruel and
unkind to the third girl, whose name was
Marfa. This was because Marfa was her
stepdaughter. She made Marfa get up early
in the morning to work, while her stepsisters
were having a nice nap. The poor girl had
to feed the cattle, bring in the wood, make
the fire, and sweep the room. After this she
must mend the clothes and do many other
things before the rest of the family stirred.
What a hard time she had, poor child! And
then she was only scolded for her labour.</p>

<p>She did not have a kind word from any one
except her old father, and then only when
they were alone together. He was afraid of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span>
his wife, and did not dare to be good to Marfa
when the others were around. She was a
beautiful girl, and was sweet and patient,
besides. Her stepmother was jealous of her
because she was so much lovelier than her
sisters. The old woman said to herself, "I
will put the girl out of my sight and get rid
of her. I hate her."</p>

<p>That very night she said to her husband,
"Come, old man, get up early in the morning
and harness the horse. Take Marfa away on
a visit." Then she turned to her stepdaughter,
and said, "Put your clothes together and
dress neatly when you get up, for your father
will be ready to take you away."</p>

<p>The girl was delighted. She thought how
nice it would be to go where people would
be kind to her. Morning came. Marfa
washed herself carefully, prayed to God, put
on her best dress, and looked lovely enough
to be a bride.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span></p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 339px;">
<img src="images/illus037.jpg" width="339" height="500" alt="Girl in pretty dress sitting in snow, Frost approaching" />
<div class="caption">MARFA AND FROST.</div>
</div>

<p>The old stepmother called her to a breakfast
of cold cabbage soup, and then said to
her, "Now, Marfa, get out of my sight for
ever. I have seen enough of you. The
sledge is at the door. Husband, take Marfa
to her bridegroom. Go straight down the
road, turn to the right, go up the hill till you
come to an old pine-tree, and there leave
the girl for Frost. He will soon come to get
her."</p>

<p>The poor old father looked sad enough
when he heard these words, but he did not dare
to disobey his wife. He and Marfa got into
the sledge and rode away slowly. His daughter
was weeping bitterly. In a little while
they came to the place where they were
ordered to stop. Marfa got out and sat down
under the pine-tree. The old man rode
away. He thought he should never see his
darling child again. He wept at the thought
Soon he was out of sight.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span></p>

<p>There was nothing but snow for Marfa to
look upon now. The ground was covered
with great drifts. The bushes were buried
under it. The branches of the trees were
bending under its weight. Not a sound could
be heard save the falling of icicles and the
creaking steps of Frost as he leaped from tree
to tree.</p>

<p>Marfa was chilled through. Her teeth
chattered. Her lips were blue and stiff. She
was too cold to sob or cry out. Frost was
coming nearer and nearer. Pretty soon he
was in the tree above Marfa's head. He cried
out, "Maiden, are you warm?" "Oh, yes,
quite warm enough, dear Father Frost," she
answered. Then he came down from the tree.
Now she was almost frozen.</p>

<p>He called again, "Are you warm, my sweet
girl? Are you sure you are warm enough?"
By this time Marfa was so numb she could
hardly move her lips. But she tried to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span>
answer, "Oh, yes, dearest sir, I am warm
enough." Frost took pity on the poor patient
maiden. He brought furs and warm blankets
and wrapped her up in them. Then he left
her.</p>

<p>She slept unharmed all night, and, when
she woke in the morning, she found gifts of
rich clothing which Frost had brought her in
the night. Her father soon appeared with the
sledge. He had expected to find her dead
body, but she was well and healthy. Not even
a finger was frozen. How the old man rejoiced.
He took Marfa and her fine presents into the
sledge, and they rode home together.</p>

<p>You can imagine how angry the stepmother
was when she saw the girl again. But when
she heard how kind Frost had been, and saw
the beautiful clothing he had given Marfa,
she said, "Husband, you must take my girls
to their bridegroom. He will be far kinder
to them than he has been to Marfa, I am<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span>
sure of that." Then she said to her daughters,
"I have found a bridegroom for you.
You must go to meet him."</p>

<p>The next morning the girls got up and
dressed themselves in their best. They were
very happy. They thought to themselves,
"Oh, my, what a fine time we shall have!"
They got into the sledge with their father and
away they went. They soon came to the pine-tree
where Marfa had stayed the other night.
They got out and sat down. Their father
drove away.</p>

<p>The girls began to laugh together. They
said, "What a queer idea of mother to send
us here for a bridegroom,&mdash;as if there were
not enough young men in the village." It
was bitter cold, and they soon began to get
cross and quarrel with each other. One of
them said, "Suppose only one bridegroom
comes, whom will he take?" "It will be I,
of course," was her sister's reply. "Indeed,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>
no," exclaimed the other; "I will be the
chosen one." They grew colder and colder,
stiffer and stiffer. But they kept quarrelling
and calling each other bad names.</p>

<p>Frost was some way off, but the girls now
heard him cracking his fingers and snapping
the pine-trees. "Listen, some one is coming.
I hear sleigh-bells," said the older sister. But
the other would not listen. She declared she
was too cold.</p>

<p>Frost came nearer and nearer. At last he
stood in front of the two girls. He spoke
to them just as he had to Marfa before.
"Well, my darlings, are you cold?" But the
girls only answered with bad words. They
called Frost names such as no wise person
would dare to speak to this great being. Yet
again he called out, "Are you warm, my
pretty ones?" And again they answered him
with curses. But as they did so they fell dead
to the ground.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span></p>

<p>The next morning the old woman said
to her husband, "Come, harness the horse
quickly, and go fetch the girls home. There
was a terrible frost last night. They must
be half-dead with cold." The father did as
she bid him, and drove away to the pine-tree.
But what did he see? Two lifeless bodies,
frozen stiff! He put them in the sledge, covered
them over, and carried them home. As
he drove up to the cottage, the old woman
went out to meet her daughters.</p>

<p>What a sight was there! The girls had
indeed met their bridegroom, but it was Death.
After this the old woman treated her stepdaughter
all the worse for awhile, but she
soon got over it. She grew kind and loving.
They lived pleasantly ever after.</p>

<p>Marfa married a neighbour who had a
good home to give her. She and her children
are very happy. But when her children
are naughty, their grandfather frightens them<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span>
by saying, "Look out, or Frost will get
you."</p>

<p>Petrovna and Ivan shiver as the story ends,
and draw nearer their dear mamma, as though
she could protect them from any danger.</p>

<p>The long, cold winter is gone at last. The
ice of the river begins to break up. It has
been frozen solid for months, but now it is
cracking and softening and beginning to move
out to the sea. The commander of the fort on
the opposite side of the river discovered this
last midnight. He did not wait a single
moment. He started at once to carry the
glad news to the Emperor, while cannon
were fired off from the fort.</p>

<p>When he reached the palace, perhaps you
think the attendants kept him waiting because
the Czar was asleep. Not at all. He was
shown at once into the royal presence. He
presented the Czar with a goblet filled with
ice-cold water he had brought from the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span>
river. This was his way of stating the good
news. The Emperor drank to the good fortune
of the city, and then filled the goblet with
silver for the bringer of the news. In olden
times the goblets grew larger every year. It
cost the Czar more money each time. At
last he said, "Let the glass always be of a
certain size, after this." Of course, that settled
it.</p>

<p>When the news was brought to the city,
everybody was glad. The next day was made
a holiday. Petrovna and Ivan were excused
from lessons and went out to see the sights.</p>

<p>Eight weeks before Easter, comes Butter-Week.
The whole city gives itself up for
seven days of feasting and festival. Pancakes
are eaten at every meal. Not like the pancakes
your mamma makes, my dears. At
least, I hope not. For the Russian pancakes,
or "blinni," as they are called, are much too
rich for your little stomachs. They are made<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span>
of flour and butter, cooked in butter, and
eaten with butter. And not only is this
greasy food eaten in quantities, but many
other things containing a great deal of fat.</p>

<p>Petrovna's mamma has a blinni party for
her friends, and Petrovna has another for her
playmates. The family are invited out to
blinni parties at other houses. They are the
queerest parties you ever heard of. Even in
the grandest houses they are held in the
kitchen. Perhaps you can guess the reason.
The cakes must be eaten hot, as soon as they
come off the griddle. Therefore the people
must sit as near the stove as possible.</p>

<p>Petrovna eats her favourite cakes, until she
can swallow nothing more. By the end of
the week her head, as well as her stomach, begins
to ache. She is all ready for the seven
weeks of fasting before Easter. She is a faithful
little girl, and never thinks of fussing because
she must now live very quietly. She<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span>
goes often to church, and repeats many prayers.
She eats the simplest food, but all Russia does
the same, so she has plenty of company.</p>

<p>The night before Easter comes at last.
Petrovna and Ivan do not go to bed as early
as usual. They leave home with their parents
a little while before midnight. They are going
to church. Everybody else in the city goes,
too.</p>

<p>The streets are full of carriages as they ride
along. Our little Russian cousins are driven
to the same cathedral to which you have been
with them before. They enter and join the
crowd of worshippers. The lights burn dimly.
All is silent. The great bell begins to ring
the midnight hour. The other bells of the city
join. As the last stroke is sounded the priests
come out through the doors of the sanctuary.
Listen! they are chanting, "Christ is risen!
Christ is risen!" The people respond, "Christ
is risen."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span></p>

<p>At the beginning of the chant all begin to
move around, kissing friends and acquaintances
in every direction. The bells keep pealing
forth the glad news. Cannon are fired off
throughout the city. Rockets are flashing
in the sky. The cathedral itself suddenly
becomes ablaze with light.</p>

<p>The kissing lasts all night and during the
next day. No one thinks of meeting another
without a cordial greeting and a kiss. Old
men kiss each other. Old women kiss, children
kiss. The Emperor kisses all those of
his household. Petrovna's papa kisses his
clerks. Petrovna herself, dear little maiden,
kisses right and left, with the most loving
heart in the world. For this is Easter-time,
the glorious time when all should love each
other and show it as best they can.</p>

<p>Feasting begins with the kissing. It is
a great holiday for everybody. Petrovna's
mamma has a grand dinner-party for her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span>
friends. But she does not forget those who
are not so well off as herself. Many a basket
of good things is sent out to poor homes.
Many a blessing is given our little Petrovna,
who rides about the city leaving her mamma's
gifts. Yes, indeed, it is a beautiful time, this
Easter day in Russia.</p>

<p>As the weather gets warmer, Petrovna begins
to look forward to the great fair of Nijni-Novgorod.
It will be a long, long journey.
She has never travelled so far in her life before.
But dear kind papa has promised her
she shall go with him this time. He travels
there himself every year to trade with the
merchants of far-away countries.</p>

<p>The day before they are ready to start, he
comes home earlier than usual from his place
of business. He says, "Come, Petrovna and
Ivan, ask the maid to put on your best
clothes. I am going to take you to the
Winter Palace. You have teased me to take<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span>
you there often enough. Hurry, or we shall
not have time."</p>

<p>The children scamper away. They are
soon dressed. Their papa looks at his pretty
children with pride, as he helps them into the
carriage. Away they dash over the pavements
till they draw up in front of an immense building.
It is painted brownish-red and yellow.
The outside is ornamented with the figures
of angels, and many other beautiful things.</p>

<p>This is the Winter Palace. It is the largest
residence in the whole world. Six thousand
people live in it. Shouldn't you be afraid of
getting lost there? There is a story that a
servant kept some cows in one of the garrets
there, a long time ago, and no one found it
out for a long while.</p>

<p>Petrovna and Ivan open their eyes wide
as they pass through the high gilded halls;
they see so many beautiful things to admire.
Such richly carved chairs and tables! Such<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span>
immense vases of malachite and jasper and
porphyry! So many fine paintings of the
Czars and generals and other great people of
Russia!</p>

<p>In the throne-room of Peter the Great the
walls are hung with red velvet. Golden eagles
are beautifully embroidered upon it. But the
royal jewels! How Petrovna's blue eyes
sparkle as she looks upon the crown of her
Emperor. It is in the shape of a dome, and
is studded with large diamonds, with a border
of pearls. At the very top of it is an immense
ruby. It is very beautiful. The Empress's
coronet is most dainty. It is of diamonds of
the same size. It is enough to dazzle one
with its beauty. In the room where these
jewels are kept and guarded there are many
others noted all over the world.</p>

<p>The sceptre of the Czar bears one of the
largest diamonds ever discovered. Many
years ago a rich count gave it to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span>
Empress Catherine II. There are bracelets
and necklaces and coronets made of precious
stones. It seems as though Petrovna and
Ivan had suddenly landed in the cave of
Aladdin.</p>

<p>But it is getting late. It is long after their
dinner hour. They must leave these beautiful
sights and hasten home to mamma.</p>

<p>The morning for the great journey comes.
It finds our Russian cousins awake bright and
early. The trunks are strapped, the dear
baby brother is fondly kissed, and papa,
mamma, Petrovna, and Ivan begin their
long ride. They pass many little villages as
the express train rushes along. Then they go
onward over great plains of barley and rye.
The train is crowded with others, who are
taking the same journey as themselves, and
papa talks with many friends who have business
at the great fair.</p>

<p>They travel all day and all night, besides<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span>
several hours of the next day. As they near
the end, the weather grows warmer, the trees
are larger and the grass greener than at home.
For they are farther south. They are too
tired to look out of the windows any longer.
Petrovna is dozing away, and dreaming of her
loved ice-hill, when she finds herself gently
shaken. Mamma is smiling at her and saying,
"Wake up, my darling, we are here at last."</p>

<p>The train has stopped. Every one is
getting out. Our little cousins are helped out
of the car into a comfortable low carriage and
are driven to a grand hotel. A good dinner
is served, and Petrovna and Ivan are put to
bed. They must get rested and prepare for
the excitement of the coming week. They
are both so tired and sleepy they are glad
to rest after the long, hard journey.</p>

<p>Perhaps you do not know that this great
fair is held every year for the benefit of the
people of Asia as well as Russia. After a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span>
long night's sleep our merchant's family go
out into the streets of the old city and see
many curious sights. Men of many nations
are gathered together. Chinamen with their
long queues and big sleeves are jostling Persians
in flowing silk robes and gay turbans.
Here are Cossacks mounted on fine horses
acting as policemen. There are some gypsies
on their way to the fair. They expect to
tell fortunes and make much money out of
the curious peasants.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 342px;">
<img src="images/illus046.jpg" width="342" height="500" alt="woman sitting on ground holding baby, people behind her" />
<div class="caption">THE GREAT FAIR OF NIJNI-NOVGOROD.</div>
</div>

<p>What a bustle and commotion! What a
discord of strange languages on every side!
What variety of costumes, and, above all,
what dust!</p>

<p>The fair grounds are about a mile from the
hotel. Our little cousins are in as much of a
hurry to get there as you would be. It does
not take long, however, for the driver of their
carriage hurries his horses onward through the
crowd.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span></p>

<p>Now for the fair itself. It is arranged in
the shape of a triangle, and covers a square
mile. Not an inch of space is wasted. Everything
is in order. Every trade has a street of
its own. Many of the bazaars have signs in
front. These bear the names of all the goods
that are sold inside. Petrovna's papa is, of
course, interested most in the tea. He wishes
to buy a large stock of it for his trade at
home. There are many kinds to choose from.
But he must be sure to get some of the delicious
yellow tea, which he will sell for fifteen
dollars a pound. It is said to be made from
the flowers of a certain kind of tea-plant, and
is quite rare. The wealthy people of Russia
like it so much that no one else in the world
gets a chance to buy any. So I have heard,
at least. If you should drink ever so little of
it, you might be kept awake all night. Yet
it looks very weak.</p>

<p>Besides many expensive teas, Petrovna's<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span>
papa orders a large supply of tea-bricks.
They are made out of the refuse of the tea,
and can be sold to the peasants. Poor creatures!
they are glad enough to get this poor
stuff, if they cannot afford better.</p>

<p>Now follow Petrovna as she stops at the
booth of this richly dressed Persian. See the
beautiful rugs and carpets hung up for sale.
They will last a lifetime for those who have
money enough to buy them.</p>

<p>Here is a whole street devoted to the sale
of silks. There are many beautiful shades.
Petrovna shall have a piece of delicate yellow
to make her a new party dress, while her
mamma chooses one of rich brocade. It is
heavy enough to stand alone.</p>

<p>Let us go with our travellers and look with
them at these exquisite gems,&mdash;amethysts,
crystals, and the clearest of topaz. Petrovna's
papa will buy one of these, no doubt. He
will have it set in a ring to give his wife.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span></p>

<p>Besides all the rich and rare things which
Asia can send to the fair, Russia furnishes
many things to exchange with her great neighbour.
There are all kinds of goods, which
have been made in the factories of her cities.
The most important are the cotton goods,
the cutlery, and the fine articles of silver.
There are also immense stores of wheat, barley,
and other grains, and quantities of dried
fruits.</p>

<p>Especially for her own people, there are
bazaars and bazaars filled with samovars of
every style, rich furs from the animals of the
cold lands of the north, and candles by
millions.</p>

<p>Day after day, Petrovna and Ivan wander
about the fair grounds. Each time they see
something new they wish to buy. When they
are tired of looking about in the bazaars, they
go to one of the concert-halls. They will be
sure to hear some music they like. Or else<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span>
they go to a theatre, and see a play that makes
them laugh till their sides are sore. Perhaps
they watch the performance of some jugglers,
and try to discover how they do their wonderful
tricks. Quite often they go into one of
the restaurants with papa. While he is drinking
tea and talking over prices with the men
he meets, the children have a dainty lunch,
and watch the waiters. What queer-looking
people they are! They are Tartars. They
look much like the Chinese, except that their
heads are shaven. They wear white linen
shirts and trousers. Their feet are bound
with pieces of cloth and encased in sandals.</p>

<p>Among other things, Petrovna watches a
band of gypsies. They are the very ones she
saw in the streets the day she arrived in the
city. Some of them are old and withered and
ugly. They look like witches. But others
are young and quite handsome, with their
black hair and bright dark eyes. The women<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span>
wear bright-coloured handkerchiefs around
their heads, and shawls over their shoulders.</p>

<p>Look! Watch that young girl as she
dances and twirls her skirt. She is certainly
very pretty and graceful. She stops now and
comes up to Petrovna. She wishes to tell her
fortune. Mamma says yes. Our little girl
gives the gypsy a piece of silver and holds
out her hand. The gypsy notices her fine
clothing, looks well at her mamma, then closely
examines the little white palm. She tells the
child that she will be very happy and do
much good in the world. As she grows up
she will marry a rich count and live in a grand
mansion. She says many more pleasant things
will happen, and Petrovna smiles and believes
it all.</p>

<p>Let us leave our dear little cousin here for
the present. Let us hope that the gypsy's
prophecy is a true one.</p>

<div class='adtitle3'>THE LITTLE COLONEL <small>(Trade Mark.)</small></div>

<p>The scene of this story is laid in Kentucky. Its heroine
is a small girl, who is known as the Little Colonel,
on account of her fancied resemblance to an old-school
Southern gentleman, whose fine estate and old family
are famous in the region.</p>


<div class='adtitle3'>THE GIANT SCISSORS</div>

<p>This is the story of Joyce and of her adventures in
France. Joyce is a great friend of the Little Colonel,
and in later volumes shares with her the delightful experiences
of the "House Party" and the "Holidays."</p>


<div class='adtitle3'>TWO LITTLE KNIGHTS OF KENTUCKY.</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Who Were the Little Colonel's Neighbors.</span></p>

<p>In this volume the Little Colonel returns to us like an
old friend, but with added grace and charm. She is not,
however, the central figure of the story, that place being
taken by the "two little knights."</p>


<div class='adtitle3'>MILDRED'S INHERITANCE.</div>

<p>A delightful little story of a lonely English girl who
comes to America and is befriended by a sympathetic
American family who are attracted by her beautiful
speaking voice. By means of this one gift she is enabled
to help a school-girl who has temporarily lost the
use of her eyes, and thus finally her life becomes a busy,
happy one.</p>
